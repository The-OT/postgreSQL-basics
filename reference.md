## Some basic things to remember:

- COMMENT OUT(preferred) or DELETE THE PRE EXISTING QUERIES WHILE RUNNING A NEW QUERY SO THAT THE NEW QUERY AND THE OLD ONES DONT CONFLICT

- serial means that the value will be generated automatically and increased automatically

- PRIMARY KEY is unique identification

- NOT NULL is used when any value MUST be entered

- DEFAULT is the basic value that will be added

- concatenate string using ||

- UPDATE, DELETE, etc..
